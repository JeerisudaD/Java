Map in Java:
Its a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.
1) Searching is efficient.
2) we can use any types of keys like Double String char etc. we are not restricted to int based natural indexes.

Retrieval :
means getting back the data from a data structure

There are many type of maps but, we will be discussing only four of them.
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap
4) HashTable(old)

HashMap :
1) HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
2)insertion order is not maintained
3)Most widely used map

LinkedHashMap
1) LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order
2) Insertion speed is same as HashMap
3) Retrieval is the slowest one

Treemap :
1) Data is sorted based on the natural order
2) Insertion is slowest because of the sorting
